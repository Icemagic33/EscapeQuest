## Introduction - Two-Player Catch Game Inside a Maze
2 Player Catch Game Inside a Maze

Welcome to the repository for an exhilarating two-player catch game set within a maze, designed for the Nios II processor environment. This game is a thrilling chase where strategy, speed, and spatial awareness come into play in a dynamically changing maze environment. Itâ€™s perfect for those who love a good challenge and enjoy pitting their reflexes and wit against another player.

## Game Overview
In this game, two players navigate through a maze with distinct objectives:

Player 1's goal is to reach a green checkpoint within the maze before being caught by Player 2. This checkpoint is not static; it changes its location every 10 seconds, adding a layer of unpredictability and excitement to the game.
Player 2's mission is to catch Player 1 before they can reach their checkpoint. Player 2 must strategize and predict Player 1's moves to catch them swiftly.
The maze serves as an ever-present obstacle that both players must navigate cleverly. Player 1 is under the pressure of time, with only 45 seconds to complete their mission and reach the green checkpoint.

## Controls
Player 1 uses the AWSD keys to navigate through the maze.
Player 2 uses the arrow keys for movement, aiming to catch Player 1.
